## üí° Usage Examples

### Basic Tax Queries

- "What are the current income tax rates in Pakistan?"
- "When is the filing deadline for salaried individuals?"
- "What deductions can I claim on my tax return?"

### Tax Calculations

- "Calculate tax for income of 2,000,000"
- "How much tax do I owe on 1,500,000 annual income?"
- "What's my net income after tax on 3,000,000?"

### Specific Information

- "What is the withholding tax rate on bank interest?"
- "How do I file my tax return online?"
- "What documents do I need for tax filing?"

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Streamlit Frontend** (`app.py`)
   - User interface and chat management
   - Session state handling
   - Real-time response display

2. **LLM Integration** (`utils/llm_utils.py`)
   - Multi-provider LLM support
   - Intelligent query routing
   - Fallback response system

3. **Tax Data Engine** (`tax_data/pakistan_tax_data.py`)
   - Current tax slabs and rates
   - Tax calculation algorithms
   - Structured tax information

4. **Text Processing** (`utils/text_processing.py`)
   - Query categorization
   - Keyword extraction
   - Response formatting

5. **Error Handling** (`utils/error_handler.py`)
   - Robust error management
   - Logging and monitoring
   - Graceful degradation

### Data Flow

1. User submits query through Streamlit interface
2. Text processor analyzes and categorizes the query
3. System checks for structured data responses first
4. If needed, query is sent to configured LLM provider
5. Response is formatted and displayed to user
6. Interaction is logged for analytics

## üîÑ Extending to Other Tax Regimes

TaxNova is designed with extensibility in mind. To add support for additional tax types:

### 1. Create New Tax Data Module

```python
# tax_data/sales_tax_data.py
class PakistanSalesTaxData:
    def __init__(self):
        self.standard_rate = 18
        self.reduced_rates = {...}
        # Add sales tax specific data
```

### 2. Update Text Processing

```python
# utils/text_processing.py
self.tax_keywords = {
    'sales_tax': ['sales tax', 'gst', 'vat'],
    'corporate_tax': ['corporate', 'company tax'],
    # Add new categories
}
```

### 3. Extend LLM Context

```python
# utils/llm_utils.py
def _get_enhanced_tax_context(self, category: str) -> str:
    if category == "sales_tax":
        return self._get_sales_tax_context()
    # Add new tax regime contexts
```

### 4. Update UI Components

Add new sidebar sections and help text for the additional tax regimes in `app.py`.

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Install test dependencies
pip install pytest pytest-cov

# Run unit tests
pytest tests/

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=utils --cov=tax_data tests/
```

### Manual Testing

1. **Basic Functionality**
   - Test chat interface responsiveness
   - Verify message history persistence
   - Check error handling for invalid inputs

2. **Tax Calculations**
   - Test various income levels
   - Verify calculation accuracy
   - Check edge cases (zero income, very high income)

3. **LLM Integration**
   - Test with different API providers
   - Verify fallback behavior
   - Check response quality and relevance

## üöÄ Deployment
